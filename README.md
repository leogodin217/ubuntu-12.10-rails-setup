ubuntu-12.10-rails-setup
========================

Simple script to setup a new Ubuntu 12.10 system with ruby, rails and associated tools

cd ubuntu-12.10-rails-setup
chmod 755 setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh

Might require intervention. Watch the screen from time to time.  


Things to do after
Setup vim: cp /usr/share/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
Enable RVM: rvm use 1.9.3 --default

Let me know of any problems or improvements. I'd like to get a good user setup as well. I have one I use at work, but is specific to my work environment. I generic one would be great.
